        "p1": "My journey in technology began long before cloud, containers, and DevOps. In the 90s, I was already exploring the world of code with Clipper and DBASE, when programming was an almost manual art — done line by line, with patience and curiosity.",
        "p2": "Over time, I evolved along with languages and tools: I went through Visual Basic, where I learned to bring graphical interfaces to life, and later dove headfirst into the world of Python and Node.js with TypeScript, building APIs, SaaS systems, and scalable solutions.",
        "p3": "Starting in 2015, I took on a new passion within technology: DevOps. That's when I began integrating development with infrastructure, automating pipelines, orchestrating containers, and making the deployment cycle something continuous, secure, and predictable. <strong>This transition taught me something I carry to this day: a system is alive, and like every organism, it needs balance, care, and constant evolution.</strong>",
        "p4": "But, outside of code, there's another part of me that also seeks this balance: wine. Over 20 years ago, it entered my life — first as curiosity, then as passion. In 2023, I completed the sommelier course and, inspired by friend Elisson Manfroi, started the hobby of \"winemaker\", producing my own wines in an artisanal way.",
