        "p1": "My journey in technology began long before cloud, containers, and DevOps. In the 90s, I was already exploring the world of code with Clipper and DBASE, when programming was an almost manual art — done line by line, with patience and curiosity.",
        "p2": "Over time, I evolved along with languages and tools: I went through Visual Basic, where I learned to bring graphical interfaces to life, and later dove headfirst into the world of Python and Node.js with TypeScript, building APIs, SaaS systems, and scalable solutions.",
        "p3": "Starting in 2015, I took on a new passion within technology: DevOps. That's when I began integrating development with infrastructure, automating pipelines, orchestrating containers, and making the deployment cycle something continuous, secure, and predictable. <strong>This transition taught me something I carry to this day: a system is alive, and like every organism, it needs balance, care, and constant evolution.</strong>",
        "p4": "But, outside of code, there's another part of me that also seeks this balance: wine. Over 20 years ago, it entered my life — first as curiosity, then as passion. In 2023, I completed the sommelier course and, inspired by friend Elisson Manfroi, started the hobby of \"winemaker\", producing my own wines in an artisanal way.",
        "p5": "This year, I decided to go further and started enology college, uniting science and sensitivity to understand every detail of the winemaking process.",

        "p1": "The idea of Bacco was born from a real need: while I was producing my own wines in an artisanal way, I realized that there was no management system in the Brazilian market that really understood the particularities of wine production in Brazil.",
        "p2": "The available systems were, for the most part, adaptations of generic ERPs or superficial translations of foreign software that did not contemplate Brazilian grape varieties, local practices, MAPA regulations, or the specific needs of small and medium wineries.",
        "p3": "That's when I decided to unite my two passions — technology and wine — to create something unique: an ERP developed from scratch, designed exclusively for Brazilian wineries, but with international standards of quality and traceability.",
        "p4": "Bacco is not just software. It is the result of years of experience in system development, technical knowledge in enology, and a deep understanding of the real needs of those who produce wine in Brazil.",
        "extra1": "More than software, Bacco represents a vision for the future of Brazilian wine — modern, authentic, and made with soul. A system that understands that each lot has a story, each fermentation a rhythm, and each wine an identity.",
